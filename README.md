# Intelligent Dictation Engine — Ready-to-Use Repository

This repository is a **complete, local, readymade scaffold** for the Intelligent Low-Latency Speech Dictation Engine (no LLMs).
It contains a runnable FastAPI demo, rule-based disfluency removal, punctuation heuristics, a GEC scaffold using `language_tool_python` fallback,
benchmarks, Dockerfile, and tests.

Important: for full production-grade behavior (best ASR models, GECToR, compact Transformers), follow the README sections to download or replace model files.
